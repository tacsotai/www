# Sotai - Squeeze out the assymetry information
Information is perceived completely differently by those who know it and those who do not. This is called information asymmetry. This site will squeeze out my mistakes that have been beaten by this.

## [Astor.js](https://astro.build/) [Commands](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/)

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev -- --host IP`| Starts local dev server at `IP:4321`             |
